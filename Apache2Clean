sudo service apache2 stop

$ sudo apt-get purge apache2 apache2-utils apache2.2-bin apache2-common
$ sudo apt-get autoremove
Finally, check if there is any configuration files or manual pages belonging to Apache2, which are still not removed.

$ whereis apache2
apache2: /etc/apache2
In this example, /etc/apache2 directory still exists. Since this directory (as well as any configuration files in it) is no longer necessary, go ahead and remove it manually.

$ sudo rm -rf /etc/apache2
